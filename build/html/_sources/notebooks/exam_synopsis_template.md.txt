# Exam Synopsis (Template)

Below is a few examples on how you could write your synopsis.  
This synopsis should be handed in on wiseflow a few weeks before the oral exam. 

## 1. Data Structures & functions
My presentation for this topic will be about the qualities and difference of the four data structures in python: List, Tuple, Set and dictionaries. I will give four examples of the practical use of each. Furthermore i will demonstrate the the use of list, set and dict comprehensions and show why a tuple comprehision does not exist but also how it could be generated. I will furthermore tell about why a comprehension often is prefered to a normal loop, and give a practical example that demonstrates this. 

## 2. Pythonic OOP
In my presentation i will focus on encapsulation and how this is achieved through the use of properties. I will give some pratical examples of first public variables and how to get and set them and then how we without making changes in the user code can add properties in our classes and achive encapsulation through these.

## 3. Generators, Decorators & Context Managers
