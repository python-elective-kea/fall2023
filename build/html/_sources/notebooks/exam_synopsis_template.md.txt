# Exam Synopsis (Template)

Below is a few examples on how you could write your synopsis.  
This synopsis should be handed in on Wiseflow a few weeks before the oral exam. 

## 1. Pythonic OOP and encapsulation
In my presentation i will focus on encapsulation and how this is achieved through the use of properties. I will give some pratical examples of first public variables and how to get and set them and then how we without making changes in the user code can add properties in our classes and achive encapsulation through these.

## 2. Build in functions
A list of pythons Build in functions can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html.    
In my presentation i will demonstrate how to use a few of these, with the focus on how easy and user friendly they make the interaction with the language. I will futhermore demonstrate how to make this uniform interface interact with ones own objects through Datamodel methods. 

## 3. Functions & Decorators
In my presentation i will demonstrate how a decorator works in a step by step example. I will furthermore show how the build in range() function actually is an object created from a class, and i will show how this could be done likewise in ones own objects.
