Session 3 - Mandatory assignment
================================
Today's lectures will be used for your first mandatory assignment. The assignment is individual, but you are welcome to work together in solving it. However, everyone should hand it in individually.

This assignment is online and can be done from home. 

**There will be no in-person instruction, and no introduction to this assignment.**

**Assignment will come later**


The final evaluation of your assignment will be conducted by Claus and will result in a pass or fail evaluation.

**Peer review** means that you will need to review the assignments of two of your classmates and provide feedback. The assignments you should review will be randomly selected by "Fronter" and you will receive a notification with a link to the assignment you should review. If you do not receive a notification, you can find the links to the assignments in the hand-in folder. This is a mandatory part of your assignment and you must complete it in order to pass the assignment.
