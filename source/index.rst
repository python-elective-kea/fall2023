Introduction to python fall 2023
=================================
Elective website for the “Introduction to python spring 2023” at KEA, Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.

These pages contains everything you need for this elective. A few resources, like literature with copyright can be found on Fronter, but will be linked to from these pages.

Underneath is a short description of each sessions learning goals.


Session 1 - Introduction to python
----------------------------------
This first week of this elective will be used for introducing this elective and making sure that you all have the software needed to follow along.

You will after this session have an:
* overview of how this elective is structured, and what you can expeted to learn during this semester.
* basic understanding of a python development enviroment, and know how to use it.
* Be able to control your computer through its command line.
* Be able to work with python strings, conditions and functions.

Session 2 - Data Structures: List & Tuples
------------------------------------------
Today's session is centered around working with data structures in Python, specifically Lists and Tuples. By the conclusion of these sessions, participants will be proficient in using Lists and Tuples, reading and writing to files, and utilizing both the "for" and "while" loops. 

Session 3 - Modules & List Comprehensions
-----------------------------------------
This session delves into Python modules, teaching participants to create and utilize both built-in and 3rd party modules. It also introduces list comprehensions as a concise method for list generation. Practical exercises involve working with specific modules like Os, Subprocesses, Zipfile, and Requests. The goal is to empower participants to fetch website data, manage files, and integrate external code seamlessly.

Session 4 - Mandatory assignment
--------------------------------
Description will come later

Session 5 - Utilities and Modules 
---------------------------------

This session delves deeper into Python modules, spotlighting the BeautifulSoup module for web scraping. Participants learn to persistently save modules in Docker containers. The curriculum includes hands-on exercises with Docker and web scraping tasks. Collaboration tools and practices, especially using Docker and GitHub, are also emphasized.

Session 6 - Functions & Decorators
----------------------------------

This session dives into Python decorators, tools that augment existing code functionality. Drawing inspiration from frameworks like Spring, decorators modularize and enhance Python code. Participants learn through practical examples, understanding the core concepts and syntax. Exercises include timing code, creating game character decorators, and building a menu register.


Session 7 - OOP
---------------

Session focuses on the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.   
By the end, participants will understand classes, objects, inheritance, and Pythonic OOP in relation to other languages like Java.   
Essential materials include the OOP in Python 3 text, a notebook on classes, and examples from teachings.   
Exercises involve creating classes for a Bank system, evaluating Python skills using ChatGPT, and building a terminal-based "Angry Bird" game using OOP.   
Participants are encouraged to explore, iterate upon, and improve given exercises for a deeper understanding.
